# Web Applications Course Repository  

gm gm! 

This repository is **just** for my university course **Web Applications**. Its only purpose is to upload assignments for the class.

If you're a **Web3 dev** checking out my public work, feel free to **ignore this repo**. The content here is super basic, just a way to submit coursework.  

**TL;DR:** This isn't part of my OSS contributions, so don't waste your time here! ðŸ˜†
